# Replace with alphabet position

### Description
In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

### Examples
```ruby
replace_with_alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
#=> "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"
```
